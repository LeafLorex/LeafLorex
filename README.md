# Build a Guessing Game in the CLI

### Skills: user input, methods, cli, looping, gets

## Instructions

## Running Your Guessing Game 

Packaged with this repository is a runner file `bin/guessing_cli`.

The "bin" directory is short for "binary", which is another way of referrering to an executable file.

The executable "bin/guessing_cli" is a Ruby file, but the ".rb" extension has
been left off. The ".rb" extension is not mandatory for Ruby files, it
is just a nice thing to have for the purposes of identifying the type of
the file. However, it is a convention to leave the file extension off of
executable files, which comes from true binary files that contain pure
machine code (1's and 0's) rather than human readable source code like
Ruby.

Assuming you are in the root directory of the guessing_cli project, run your guessing_cli from the command line with `ruby bin/guessing_cli`.

Alternatively, you can also just say `bin/guessing_cli` since a line of
code has been added to the top of the bin/guessing_cli runner file that tells
your command line shell which program to run the file with.
